# clj-swipl

A Clojure library designed to call SWI-Prolog goals directly from clojure code.

If you find it to hard to translate your prolog projects to core.logic, 
this might be your choice.

## Installation Preparations

Be sure you fulfill the JPL 3.x installation prerequisites as desribed unter [http://www.swi-prolog.org/packages/jpl/installation.html].

If you want to work yourself on this project, you have to install the SWI-Prolog java bridge jpl.jar in your local maven repository:
get and install the leiningen plugin 'localrepo',then do:

	lein localrepo install 'path-to-swi-prolog'/lib/jpl.jar jpl 3.1.4-alpha


## Usage

put something like

	(:require [clj.swipl :as pl])
	
in your namespace declaration.


Check the examples in 'swipl_demo.clj'.

Here is one of them:

	(defn q2
	  []
	  (let [query (pl/make-query-from-source "X is 1; X is 2; X is 3")
			solutions (pl/all-solutions query)]
		(println "q2: Solutions to " (pl/show-query query)  " ==> " 
				 (map #(str "X = " (pl/get-value "X" %) "; ") solutions))))
				 
	(q2)
