# clj-swipl

A Clojure library designed to call SWI-Prolog goals directly from clojure code.

If you find it to hard to translate your prolog projects to core.logic, 
this might be your choice.

## installation preparations

If you want to work yourself on this project, you have to install
 the SWI-Prolog java bridge jpl.jar in your local maven repository:
get and install the leiningen plugin 'localrepo',
then do: lein localrepo install 'path-to-swi-prolog'/lib/jpl.jar jpl 3.1.4-alpha


## Usage

put (:require [clj.swipl :as pl]) in your namespace declaration


Check the examples in 'swipl_demo.clj'.

Here is one of them:

(defn q2
  []
  (let [query (pl/make-query-from-source "X is 1; X is 2; X is 3")
        solutions (pl/all-solutions query)]
    (println "q2: Solutions to " (pl/show-query query)  " ==> " 
             (map #(str "X = " (pl/get-value "X" %) "; ") solutions))))
			 
(q2)
